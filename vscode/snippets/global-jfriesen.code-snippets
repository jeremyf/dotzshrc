{
	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Add debugger": {
		"scope": "ruby",
		"prefix": "db",
		"body": [
			"require 'byebug'; debugger; true",
			"puts 'Debug'"
		],
		"description": "Add a debugger line"
	},
	"Add “Smart Quotes”": {
		"prefix": "smq",
		"body": ["“$1”"],
		"description": "Add enclosing smart quotes"
	}
}
