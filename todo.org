** TODO Upgrade ~org-roam~ to v2

*** Capture Templates

Review capture templates; can I reduce the number of templates if I have adequate auto-tagging.  For example, does the org-roam capture template allow for a variable for tags?  If so, can I use a wrapping function to assign tags.

When I’m running or playing an RPG session, I typically want to auto-tag all ~org-roam~ nodes that I create with one or more tags.  Conceptually, I have a list of “contexts” and each “context” has a list of tags to apply.  Then I can apply additional tags.

*** Directory Structure

Review directory structure; at present the directories add tags, this may require further adjustments.
