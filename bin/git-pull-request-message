  Leverage your commit messages to build your pull request message.

  Usage: git pull-request-message [-h] [SINCE_BRANCH]

  Generate a pull request message using the commit messages from the
  HEAD of the SINCE_BRANCH to the HEAD of the current branch.

  By default, the SINCE_BRANCH is "main" but can be overridden as
  follows:

  $ git pull-request-message development

  This generates output based on the commit messages that are after the
  HEAD of the "development" branch to the HEAD of the current branch.

  Options:
    -h          display this help and exit

  Note, this script parses the git log in reverse, rendering the first
  commit on the branch at the top of the output and the last commit on
  the branch at the bottom of the output.

  This script also works best if you are have terse git commit subjects
  (e.g.  the first line)
