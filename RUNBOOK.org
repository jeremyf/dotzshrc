*** Alternate

~brew install emacs-mac  --with-dbus --with-glib --with-imagemagick --with-jansson --with-libxml2 --with-rsvg  --with-mac-metal --with-native-comp --with-natural-title-bar --with-starter  --with-emacs-sexy-icon~

** Language Servers

- Ruby :: =gem install solargraph=

- =brew install sdcv= :: the translation
- Download https://s3.amazonaws.com/jsomers/dictionary.zip
- Create =~/.stardict/dic=
- Copy the unzipped bz2 contents of the above download into =~/.stardict/dic=
- Verify by running =sdcv -l= (there should be new dictionaries)

To add to Dictionary.app:

- Grab https://github.com/ponychicken/WebsterParser dictionary zip
- Open Dictionary.app > Edit > Open Dictionaries Folder and drag contents of above zip
- Restart Dictionary.app and re-arrange dictionary order.

** Run ./install.rb

=ruby install.rb= to create various symlinks.

** SSH Keys

Ensure that I have up to date SSH keys

For Github, need to create a new app token

** Install Karabiner

Then set:

- Right option key to send ESC
- Caps lock to send CTRL
- Left shift + Right shift sends CAPS LOCK

** Install Hammerspoon

See [[https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon][Hammerspoon/hammerspoon: Staggeringly powerful macOS desktop automation with Lua]].

** The Deprecated

Prior to Raycast, I used Jumpcut (=brew cask install jumpcut=)
