** Emacs

*** From Homebrew

- =brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus=
- =brew install emacs-plus --with-debug --with-dbus --with-xwidgets --with-modern-pen-lds56-icon=

Create symlinks in =~/bin/= of emacs and emacsclient; note the =editor=
and =edaemon= files require =~/bin/emacs= and =~/bin/emacsclient=. In
adding that symlink indirection, I'm able to bring the best Emacs
installation to my ecosystem and configure with that point of
inflection.

** Download JetBrains Mono

Install this font as it's used in Emacs configuration.

** Necessary for some takeonrules dependencies

- =brew install gmp=
- =brew install gsl=

** SSH Keys

Ensure that I have up to date SSH keys

For Github, need to create a new app token

** Install Karabiner

https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/

Then set:

- Right option key to send ESC
- Caps lock to send CTRL
- Left shift + Right shift sends CAPS LOCK

** Install Hammerspoon
