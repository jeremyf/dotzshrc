#+title: README for dotzshrc

A git repository for managing my ~.zshrc~ configuration.

Below is the top-level directory structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC
├── License
├── README.md
├── RUNBOOK.md
├── bin
├── configs
├── install.rb
├── iterm
├── runbooks
├── stylesheets
└── symlinks
#+END_SRC

Two primary files are:

- RUNBOOK.md :: this is the software/scripts I install to ensure I
  have the appropirate dependencies installed.
- install.rb :: this creates the symlinks in my ~$HOME~ directory and
  ensures paths, aliases, etc. are correct in the terminal/shell.

You can run ~ruby install.rb~ to create the symlinks into the current
~$HOME~ file

*Note:* [[https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc][My dotzshrc repository]] assumes that you also have a clone of
 [[https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs][my dotemacs repository]] in the same parent directory.
